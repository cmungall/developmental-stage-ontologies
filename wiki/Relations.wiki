== Core Stage Relations ==

 * [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000050] part_of - to connect sub-stages to stages that temporally contain them
 * [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000062] preceded by - note this is the transitive version - so "CS20 preceded_by CS1" is true
 * [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002087] starts at end of - aka *immediately preceded by* - e.g CS20 starts at end of CS19
 
== Timing Relations ==

These are still experimental. Look at individual ontologies for details
