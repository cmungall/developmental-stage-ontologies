#summary Relations to be used in developmental stage ontologies

= Introduction =

This page summarizes relations to be used.

Clicking on a relation will provide documentation. You can also see how this relation is being used in other ontologies. e.g zfs.

= Details =

== Core Stage Relations ==

 * [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000050] part_of - to connect sub-stages to stages that temporally contain them
 * [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000062] preceded by - note this is the transitive version - so "CS20 preceded_by CS1" is true
 * [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002087] starts at end of - aka *immediately preceded by* - e.g CS20 starts at end of CS19

Note that a direct SubClassOf / is_a should be used to connect two stages when the parent is a grouping relation. E.g. CS1 is_a embryonic stage (ie. any stage during embryo development). Most times you will want part_of (e.g. CS1 part_of (entire) embryo stage)

== Timing Relations ==

These are still experimental. Look at individual ontologies for details.
