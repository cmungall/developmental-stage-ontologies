This page describes the medaka stage ontology (OlatDv)

OlatDv is based on the original medaka stage ontology MFO (	http://obo.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/obo/obo/ontology/anatomy/gross_anatomy/animal_gross_anatomy/fish/medaka_ontology.obo) by Thorsten Henrich.

Currently it includes only pre-adult stages.
