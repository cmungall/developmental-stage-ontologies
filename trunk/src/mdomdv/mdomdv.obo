def: "Immature stage that refers to the first 2 weeks period when the young is permanently attached to the nipple." [Bgee:curator "Bgee"]
comment: Immediately after birth, the neonate is attached to the nipple for 2 weeks before being transferred to the nest or carried on the mother's back (see http://www.faunaparaguay.com/mamm10Monodelphisdomestica.pdf). While Monodelphis domestica is a pouch-less marsupial, literature talks about pouch youngs for this marsupial species (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7750642).
