comment: Immediately after birth, the neonate is attached to the nipple for 2 weeks before being transferred to the nest or carried on the mother's back (see http://www.faunaparaguay.com/mamm10Monodelphisdomestica.pdf). While Monodelphis domestica is a pouch-less marsupial, literature talks about pouch youngs for this marsupial species (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7750642).

def: "Mature stage that refers to a adult opossum which is over 4 months and under 21 months old." [Bgee:curator "Bgee"]
comment: The life span of opossums is very short. The average female probably lives through one breeding season (see http://www.mspca.org/programs/wildlife-resources/species-information/about-opossums.html). In the wild, two years is the standard lifespan (http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Monodelphis_domestica/). We decided to consider 21 months as the upper limit for breeding age, before aged stage.
