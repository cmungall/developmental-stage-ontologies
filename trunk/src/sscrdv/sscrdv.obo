def: "Pig developmental stage that covers the period from birth until about 2 months old, at which point individuals wean." [Bgee:curator "Bgee"]
comment: Age of weaning is 56 days (see http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Sus_scrofa). Piglets are highly precocious and neonates appear with open eyes, good muscle tone and well developed skin and hair (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874755). Within minutes of being born, or sometimes seconds, they will attempt to suckle. The piglets are born with sharp teeth and fight to develop a teat order as the anterior teats produce a greater quantity of milk (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piglet_%28animal%29).
