def: "Pig developmental stage that covers the period from birth until about 2 months old, at which point individuals wean." [Bgee:curator]
comment: Age of weaning is 56 days (see http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Sus_scrofa). Piglets are highly precocious and neonates appear with open eyes, good muscle tone and well developed skin and hair (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874755). Within minutes of being born, or sometimes seconds, they will attempt to suckle. The piglets are born with sharp teeth and fight to develop a teat order as the anterior teats produce a greater quantity of milk (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piglet_%28animal%29).

def: "Pig developmental stage that covers the period from 2 months old, when individuals wean, until about 11 months old, when individuals reach sexual maturity." [Bgee:curator]
comment: Pig reach sexual maturity by 768 days of age for male, 334 days for female. While achieving sexual maturity much earlier, males do not typically mate until they are about 5 years old (see http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Sus_scrofa).
