comment: Following internal fertilization, early embryogenesis clearly proceeds within the oviduct in lizards genus Anolis, and most eggs are laid at the Early limb-bud stage of development (Stage 4). Juvenile lizards genus Anolis hatch with a snout-to-vent length of about 1.6 cm, after 22-27 days of incubation(see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17724661).

comment: Green anoles have a lifespan ranging from 2 to 8 years, determined largely by predation. Lifespan in captivity is similar to that in the wild, approximately 4 to 6 years (see http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Anolis_carolinensis/). We arbitraly consider 2 years as the upper limit for the adult stage, before aged stage. This is to improve as far as information is available.

comment: Bovine gestation is 277 days (about 9 months) (see http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Bos_taurus). Depending on the breed, the gestation time slightly varies (see http://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php?title=Bovine_Development). Gestational length is commonly calculated based on recorded insemination (see PMID:30452469), so actually this is the fetal age.

comment: On the 6th day after fertilization the goat embryo shows structural changes indicative of transformation into a blastocyst. At this time the central embryonic cells exhibit signs of strong growth, and the blastocyst cavity begins to form, see https://zootechnical.com/article/148044/en.

comment: Further embryonic development involves the disappearance of the zona pellucida, rapid growth and development of the blastulas, and the formation of the germ layer, i.e. gastrulation. In this form the embryo is implanted in the wall of the uterus, where subsequent stages of embryonic development take place. The endoderm, ectoderm and mesoderm formed during gastrulation form most of the organs and tissues, see https://zootechnical.com/article/148044/en.

def: "A molecular process that can be carried out by the action of a single macromolecular machine, usually via direct physical interactions with other molecular entities. Function in this sense denotes an action, or activity, that a gene product (or a complex) performs." [GOC:pdt]
comment: Note that, in addition to forming the root of the molecular function ontology, this term is recommended for use for the annotation of gene products whose molecular function is unknown. When this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the molecular function of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code 'no data' (ND), is used to indicate this. Despite its name, this is not a type of 'function' in the sense typically defined by upper ontologies such as Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). It is instead a BFO:process carried out by a single gene product or complex.

The use of the term "fetus" generally implies that a mammalian embryo has developed to the point of being recognizable as belonging to its own species, though the point at which this occurs is subjective.

comment: HPO (Human Phenotype Ontology) considers HP:0003581 (adult onset) as 'at the age of 16 years or later', but this adult stage directly follows the pediatric onset (HP:0410280) defined 'as before the age of 15 years' (see https://github.com/obophenotype/human-phenotype-ontology/issues/6099). To be consistent, we consider adult stage as starting at 15 years.

comment: The definition of an age for human weaning is difficult to define due to individual and cultural variations. The natural age of weaning in humans could be 2.5 years, with maximum 7.0 years (see https://www.health-e-learning.com/articles/A_Natural_Age_of_Weaning.pdf), but we decide to stop this period at 1 year-old, before usually language acquisition.

comment: The life span of opossums is very short. The average female probably lives through one breeding season (see http://www.mspca.org/programs/wildlife-resources/species-information/about-opossums.html). In the wild, two years is the standard lifespan (http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Monodelphis_domestica/). We decided to consider 21 months as the upper limit for breeding age, before aged stage.

comment: This stage actually starts at about 3.5 years, the age of sexual maturity. See 3-year-old immature stage and 3-year-old mature stage. The females of this species reach menopause at about the age of 25 (see http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Macaca_mulatta). We decided to consider this age as the upper limit for adulthood stage, before geriatric age.

Headfolds are particularly prominent. Optic placodes are first evident and become indented to form the optic pits. The heart rudiment develops rapidly. The allantois contacts the chorion at the end of this stage." [http://php.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php?title=Mouse_Stages#Theiler_Stage_12b]

comment: There is little information on the longevity of platypuses. They can live up to 12 years in the wild (see http://www.mspca.org/programs/wildlife-resources/species-information/about-platypuss.html) and one captive specimen was at least 22.6 years old when it died (see http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Ornithorhynchus_anatinus). Over 10 years old is usually no more a breeding age.

comment: comment: stage description from G.Gillard (https://github.com/garethgillard), months 3-6, 5-8 cm. Approximately 4- 5 weeks after hatching the young fish makes its way through the gravel and begins active feeding. At this point they are approximately 3 inches long and are called "fry" or fingerlings. One year after hatching the fry change coloring and acquire distinctive markings on their flanks which now distinguishes them as "parr" (http://www.uky.edu/~agrdanny/flyfish/life.htm).

def: "The day of the alevin leaving its yolk sac and beginning to be a fry." [Bgee:curator]
comment: dedicated to PMID:32293070; developmentally it makes sense to consider fry before feeding as a category. At least, when the yolk sac is depleted they are considered as at the fry stage. They fed then after that in experiments. They could feed before in the wild of course, so not completely tied to developmental stage, but a common point of difference the feeding (source: discussion with G.Gillard, https://github.com/garethgillard).

Piglets are highly precocious and neonates appear with open eyes, good muscle tone and well developed skin and hair (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874755). Within minutes of being born, or sometimes seconds, they will attempt to suckle. The piglets are born with sharp teeth and fight to develop a teat order as the anterior teats produce a greater quantity of milk (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piglet_%28animal%29).

comment: We define pig early and late embryonic stages based on fetal growth (see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15446468). Pig embryo begins to attach to the uterus on days 13–14 of pregnancy (see https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Pig_Development#Normal_Stages). At that stage, this is a 6-somite pig embryo (see https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Book_-_Embryology_of_the_Pig_5).

def: "a relation between a specifically dependent continuant (the characteristic) and any other entity (the bearer), in which the characteristic depends on the bearer for its existence." []
comment: Note that this relation was previously called "inheres in", but was changed to be called "characteristic of" because BFO2 uses "inheres in" in a more restricted fashion. This relation differs from BFO2:inheres_in in two respects: (1) it does not impose a range constraint, and thus it allows qualities of processes, as well as of information entities, whereas BFO2 restricts inheres_in to only apply to independent continuants (2) it is declared functional, i.e. something can only be a characteristic of one thing.

property_value: IAO:0000116 "This branch of the ontology deals with causal relations between entities. It is divided into two branches: causal relations between occurrents/processes, and causal relations between material entities. We take an 'activity flow-centric approach', with the former as primary, and define causal relations between material entities in terms of causal relations between occurrents.\n\nTo define causal relations in an activity-flow type network, we make use of 3 primitives:\n\n * Temporal: how do the intervals of the two occurrents relate? \n * Is the causal relation regulatory?\n * Is the influence positive or negative?\n\nThe first of these can be formalized in terms of the Allen Interval Algebra. Informally, the 3 bins we care about are 'direct', 'indirect' or overlapping. Note that all causal relations should be classified under a RO temporal relation (see the branch under 'temporally related to'). Note that all causal relations are temporal, but not all temporal relations are causal. Two occurrents can be related in time without being causally connected. We take causal influence to be primitive, elucidated as being such that has the upstream changed, some qualities of the donwstream would necessarily be modified.\n\nFor the second, we consider a relationship to be regulatory if the system in which the activities occur is capable of altering the relationship to achieve some objective. This could include changing the rate of production of a molecule.\n\nFor the third, we consider the effect of the upstream process on the output(s) of the downstream process. If the level of output is increased, or the rate of production of the output is increased, then the direction is increased. Direction can be positive, negative or neutral or capable of either direction. Two positives in succession yield a positive, two negatives in succession yield a positive, otherwise the default assumption is that the net effect is canceled and the influence is neutral.\n\nEach of these 3 primitives can be composed to yield a cross-product of different relation types." xsd:string

Thus if cells of type C1 derive_from cells of type C, then any cell division involving an instance of C1 in a given lineage is preceded_by cellular processes involving an instance of C.    The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P. Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other." xsd:string
