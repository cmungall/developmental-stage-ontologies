comment: Following internal fertilization, early embryogenesis clearly proceeds within the oviduct in lizards genus Anolis, and most eggs are laid at the Early limb-bud stage of development (Stage 4). Juvenile lizards genus Anolis hatch with a snout-to-vent length of about 1.6 cm, after 22-27 days of incubation(see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17724661).

comment: Green anoles have a lifespan ranging from 2 to 8 years, determined largely by predation. Lifespan in captivity is similar to that in the wild, approximately 4 to 6 years (see http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Anolis_carolinensis/). We arbitraly consider 2 years as the upper limit for the adult stage, before aged stage. This is to improve as far as information is available.

comment: Bovine gestation is 277 days (about 9 months) (see http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Bos_taurus). Depending on the breed, the gestation time slightly varies (see http://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php?title=Bovine_Development). Gestational length is commonly calculated based on recorded insemination (see PMID:30452469), so actually this is the fetal age.

comment: Temporal ordering number - 257. Not to be confused with mitotic domain 14B, which is a domain of cells in the dorsal midline of the head that don't undergo a 14th division (Foe, 1989). The asynchronous nature of cycle 14 divisions means that this is not very useful for annotating stage. If possible a standard embryonic stage should be used instead.

comment: Temporal ordering number - 570. DISAMBIGUATION: In Drosophila lab vernacular, the term 'pupal stage' is often used to refer to the entire period from formation of the puparium to eclosion. However, this does not correspond to the standard usage of 'pupal stage' for Cyclorrhaphous flies (for discussion see: FBrf0087128). Briefly: formation of the puparium (hardening of the larval cuticle) marks the beginning of the pre-pupal stage. The pupal stage begins following pupal/larval apolysis - detachment of the larval epidermis from the puparium. In Drosophila, the outward sign of the completion of apolysis is the eversion of the head and expulsion of the larval mouthparts (FBrf0036849). We use P-stage to refer to the stage from pupariation to eclosion, and restrict pupal stage to its standard usage.

def: "The stage of the Drosophila life-cycle from the formation of the puparium (beginning of the prepupal stage) to eclosion." [FBC:DOS]
comment: Temporal ordering number - 490. DISAMBIGUATION: In Drosophila lab vernacular, the term 'pupal stage' is often used to refer to the entire period from formation of the puparium to eclosion. However, this does not correspond to the standard usage of 'pupal stage' for cyclorrhaphous flies (for discussion see: FBrf0087128). Briefly: formation of the puparium (hardening of the larval cuticle) marks the beginning of the pre-pupal stage. The pupal stage begins following pupal/larval apolysis - detachment of the larval epidermis from the puparium. In Drosophila, the outward sign of the completion of apolysis is the eversion of the head an expulsion of the larval mouthparts (FBrf0036849). We use P-stage to refer to the stage from pupariation to eclosion, and restrict pupal stage to its standard usage.

comment: Prenatal development is a continuum, with no clear defining feature distinguishing an embryo from a fetus. The use of the term "fetus" generally implies that a mammalian embryo has developed to the point of being recognizable as belonging to its own species, though the point at which this occurs is subjective.

comment: HPO (Human Phenotype Ontology) considers HP:0003581 (adult onset) as 'at the age of 16 years or later', but this adult stage directly follows the pediatric onset (HP:0410280) defined 'as before the age of 15 years' (see https://github.com/obophenotype/human-phenotype-ontology/issues/6099). To be consistent, we consider adult stage as starting at 15 years.

comment: The definition of an age for human weaning is difficult to define due to individual and cultural variations. The natural age of weaning in humans could be 2.5 years, with maximum 7.0 years (see https://www.health-e-learning.com/articles/A_Natural_Age_of_Weaning.pdf), but we decide to stop this period at 1 year-old, before usually language acquisition.

comment: The life span of opossums is very short. The average female probably lives through one breeding season (see http://www.mspca.org/programs/wildlife-resources/species-information/about-opossums.html). In the wild, two years is the standard lifespan (http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Monodelphis_domestica/). We decided to consider 21 months as the upper limit for breeding age, before aged stage.

comment: The life span of opossums is very short. The average female probably lives through one breeding season (see http://www.mspca.org/programs/wildlife-resources/species-information/about-opossums.html). In the wild, two years is the standard lifespan (http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Monodelphis_domestica/). We arbitraly consider 20 months as the upper limit for the adult, before aged stage. This is to improve as far as information is available.

comment: This stage actually starts at about 3.5 years, the age of sexual maturity. See 3-year-old immature stage and 3-year-old mature stage. The females of this species reach menopause at about the age of 25 (see http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Macaca_mulatta). We decided to consider this age as the upper limit for adulthood stage, before geriatric age.

comment: There is little information on the longevity of platypuses. They can live up to 12 years in the wild (see http://www.mspca.org/programs/wildlife-resources/species-information/about-platypuss.html) and one captive specimen was at least 22.6 years old when it died (see http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Ornithorhynchus_anatinus). Over 10 years old is usually no more a breeding age.

comment: comment: stage description from G.Gillard (https://github.com/garethgillard), months 3-6, 5-8 cm. Approximately 4- 5 weeks after hatching the young fish makes its way through the gravel and begins active feeding. At this point they are approximately 3 inches long and are called "fry" or fingerlings. One year after hatching the fry change coloring and acquire distinctive markings on their flanks which now distinguishes them as "parr" (http://www.uky.edu/~agrdanny/flyfish/life.htm).

comment: dedicated to PMID:32293070; developmentally it makes sense to consider fry before feeding as a category. At least, when the yolk sac is depleted they are considered as at the fry stage. They fed then after that in experiments. They could feed before in the wild of course, so not completely tied to developmental stage, but a common point of difference the feeding (source: discussion with G.Gillard, https://github.com/garethgillard).

comment: Age of weaning is 56 days (see http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Sus_scrofa). Piglets are highly precocious and neonates appear with open eyes, good muscle tone and well developed skin and hair (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874755). Within minutes of being born, or sometimes seconds, they will attempt to suckle. The piglets are born with sharp teeth and fight to develop a teat order as the anterior teats produce a greater quantity of milk (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piglet_%28animal%29).

comment: Pig reach sexual maturity by 768 days of age for male, 334 days for female. While achieving sexual maturity much earlier, males do not typically mate until they are about 5 years old (see http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Sus_scrofa).

comment: We define pig early and late embryonic stages based on fetal growth (see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15446468). Pig embryo begins to attach to the uterus on days 13–14 of pregnancy (see https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Pig_Development#Normal_Stages). At that stage, this is a 6-somite pig embryo (see https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Book_-_Embryology_of_the_Pig_5).

Cell  fates,  including  cell divisions and expression of cell fate markers, are equivalent between L3 and PDL3 stages (Liu and Ambros, 1991; Euling  and  Ambros,  1996;  Braendle  and  Félix,  2008;  Karp  and  Greenwald,  2013).  However,  no  molt  occurs between dauer and PDL3. Thus, dauer alae are still visible on the cuticle, although more difficult to see because they become stretched as the larva loses radial constriction and begins to grow (Cassada and Russell, 1975; Riddle et al.,1997).\"" xsd:string {xref="PMID:27417559"}

The buds elongate and the cells at their bases seem to diminish in number. Very early on a furrow appears in the elongated buds, delimiting anterior (scolex) and caudal (body) regions. Hooks are the first fully-differentiated structures formed at the apical region of the nascent scolex. A cone can later be seen at the center of the hooks, the body is expanded and a structured neck is evident between the scolex and the body. During protoscolex development this parasitic form remains attached to the germinative layer through a stalk. When fully differentiated, the stalk is cut off and the infective protoscolex is now free in the hydatid fluid. This stage ends when the protoscolex attaches, via the scolex, to the host intestinal tissue and begins to develop into a adult." [PMID:12462989, WB:jl]

PDL4 larvae are morphologically indistinguishable from L4 larvae, at least at the gross level. Similarly, PDadults appear identical to adults that developed continuously. However, subtle differences do exist. For example,some changes in muscle arm and neuronal cell structure persist in post-dauer stages (Dixon et al., 2008; Schroeder et al., 2013). Interestingly, this apparent similarity between post-dauer and continuously developed animals belies a number of changes at the level of expression of protein coding and small RNA coding genes, as well as changes in chromatin structure (Hall et al., 2010; Karp et al., 2011; Hall et al., 2013).\"" xsd:string {xref="PMID:27417559"}

Where derives_from links classes of continuants, preceded_by links classes of processes. Clearly, however, these two relations are not independent of each other. Thus if cells of type C1 derive_from cells of type C, then any cell division involving an instance of C1 in a given lineage is preceded_by cellular processes involving an instance of C.    The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P. Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other." xsd:string

In most subsequent forms, many of these early ribs have been lost, and in living amphibians and reptiles, there is great variation in rib structure and number. For example, turtles have only eight pairs of ribs, which are developed into a bony or cartilagenous carapace and plastron, while snakes have numerous ribs running along the full length of their trunk. Frogs typically have no ribs, aside from a sacral pair, which form part of the pelvis. Mammals usually also only have distinct ribs on the thoracic vertebra, although fixed cervical ribs are also present in monotremes. In marsupials and placental mammals, the cervical and lumbar ribs are found only as tiny remnants fused to the vertebrae, where they are referred to as transverse processes. In general, the structure and number of the true ribs in humans is similar to that in other mammals. Unlike reptiles, caudal ribs are never found in mammals." xsd:string
