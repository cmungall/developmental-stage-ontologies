comment: For now, in Bgee, dev. stages can have only one direct parent by part_of relation. In Uberon, UBERON:0007221 neonate stage is both part_of UBERON:0018685 nursing stage, in mammalia, and of UBERON:0000112 sexually immature stage in other species. To accomodate Bgee, for now we merge GgalDv:0000004 hwith UBERON:0007221 neonate, as it should. This should be reverted when Bgee updates, by adding a xref to UBERON:0007221
