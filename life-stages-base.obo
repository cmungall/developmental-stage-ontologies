comment: Following internal fertilization, early embryogenesis clearly proceeds within the oviduct in lizards genus Anolis, and most eggs are laid at the Early limb-bud stage of development (Stage 4). Juvenile lizards genus Anolis hatch with a snout-to-vent length of about 1.6 cm, after 22-27 days of incubation(see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17724661).

comment: Green anoles have a lifespan ranging from 2 to 8 years, determined largely by predation. Lifespan in captivity is similar to that in the wild, approximately 4 to 6 years (see http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Anolis_carolinensis/). We arbitraly consider 2 years as the upper limit for the adult stage, before aged stage. This is to improve as far as information is available.

comment: Bovine gestation is 277 days (about 9 months) (see http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Bos_taurus). Depending on the breed, the gestation time slightly varies (see http://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php?title=Bovine_Development). Gestational length is commonly calculated based on recorded insemination (see PMID:30452469), so actually this is the fetal age.

comment: Prenatal development is a continuum, with no clear defining feature distinguishing an embryo from a fetus. The use of the term "fetus" generally implies that a mammalian embryo has developed to the point of being recognizable as belonging to its own species, though the point at which this occurs is subjective.

comment: HPO (Human Phenotype Ontology) considers HP:0003581 (adult onset) as 'at the age of 16 years or later', but this adult stage directly follows the pediatric onset (HP:0410280) defined 'as before the age of 15 years' (see https://github.com/obophenotype/human-phenotype-ontology/issues/6099). To be consistent, we consider adult stage as starting at 15 years.

comment: The definition of an age for human weaning is difficult to define due to individual and cultural variations. The natural age of weaning in humans could be 2.5 years, with maximum 7.0 years (see https://www.health-e-learning.com/articles/A_Natural_Age_of_Weaning.pdf), but we decide to stop this period at 1 year-old, before usually language acquisition.

comment: The life span of opossums is very short. The average female probably lives through one breeding season (see http://www.mspca.org/programs/wildlife-resources/species-information/about-opossums.html). In the wild, two years is the standard lifespan (http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Monodelphis_domestica/). We decided to consider 21 months as the upper limit for breeding age, before aged stage.

comment: This stage actually starts at about 3.5 years, the age of sexual maturity. See 3-year-old immature stage and 3-year-old mature stage. The females of this species reach menopause at about the age of 25 (see http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Macaca_mulatta). We decided to consider this age as the upper limit for adulthood stage, before geriatric age.

comment: TS27 is used for annotation of postnatal days 0 through 3 (P0 to P3). This is a somewhat arbitrary cut-off but seems to best fit the data we have encountered. TS28 is then used from postnatal day 4 onward. [https://github.com/tfhayamizu]

comment: This term was obsoleted to include the mature stage into the ontology. Both terms have the same children, but contains of children (children of children) differ. The organisation of the postnatal development time in mouse is debatable, literature usually refers to mature or immature mice, with milestone around 6-8 weeks post-natal.

comment: There is little information on the longevity of platypuses. They can live up to 12 years in the wild (see http://www.mspca.org/programs/wildlife-resources/species-information/about-platypuss.html) and one captive specimen was at least 22.6 years old when it died (see http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Ornithorhynchus_anatinus). Over 10 years old is usually no more a breeding age.

comment: Embryo develops in 146 days (see http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Ovis_aries). Bgee_curator_notes: Bgee prenatal stage definition differs from Uberon embryonic stage definition by the notion of birth for stage ending, while Uberon ends with fully formed embryo. We maybe have to correct our too precise definition.

comment: comment: stage description from G.Gillard (https://github.com/garethgillard), months 3-6, 5-8 cm. Approximately 4- 5 weeks after hatching the young fish makes its way through the gravel and begins active feeding. At this point they are approximately 3 inches long and are called "fry" or fingerlings. One year after hatching the fry change coloring and acquire distinctive markings on their flanks which now distinguishes them as "parr" (http://www.uky.edu/~agrdanny/flyfish/life.htm).

def: "The day of the alevin leaving its yolk sac and beginning to be a fry." [Bgee:curator]
comment: dedicated to PMID:32293070; developmentally it makes sense to consider fry before feeding as a category. At least, when the yolk sac is depleted they are considered as at the fry stage. They fed then after that in experiments. They could feed before in the wild of course, so not completely tied to developmental stage, but a common point of difference the feeding (source: discussion with G.Gillard, https://github.com/garethgillard).

comment: Age of weaning is 56 days (see http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Sus_scrofa). Piglets are highly precocious and neonates appear with open eyes, good muscle tone and well developed skin and hair (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874755). Within minutes of being born, or sometimes seconds, they will attempt to suckle. The piglets are born with sharp teeth and fight to develop a teat order as the anterior teats produce a greater quantity of milk (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piglet_%28animal%29).

comment: We define pig early and late embryonic stages based on fetal growth (see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15446468). Pig embryo begins to attach to the uterus on days 13–14 of pregnancy (see https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Pig_Development#Normal_Stages). At that stage, this is a 6-somite pig embryo (see https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Book_-_Embryology_of_the_Pig_5).
